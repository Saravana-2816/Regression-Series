AI/ML Learning Journey ðŸš€
About Me
I am currently learning AI intensively as I am passionate about working on data. To develop a strong foundation of AI, I am developing 50 AI/ML projects on regression, time series forecasting, classification, NLP, and generative AI. The motive behind this is that these skills will make me a good fit for the recruiters searching for ML engineers.
